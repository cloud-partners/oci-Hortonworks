# oci-quickstart-hortonworks
This is a Terraform module that deploys [Hortonworks](https://hortonworks.com/products/) HDP on [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/cloud-infrastructure).  They are developed jointly by Oracle and Cloudera/Hortonworks.

This branch uses [OCI Resource Manager](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/resourcemanager.htm) for deployment.  A detailed guide on this process can be found [here](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/deploy-hadoop-easily-on-oracle-cloud-infrastructure-using-resource-manager)
